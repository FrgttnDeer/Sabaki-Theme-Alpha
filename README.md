## Description
This theme was adapted from the [BadukTV theme](https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/i8km9z/sabaki_theme_baduktv_style_link_in_comments) by [MooToYouToo](https://github.com/MooToYouToo/Sabaki-BadukTV-Theme/releases/tag/v0.1.0). Inspired by boards such as used in the [AlphaGo v. Lee Sedol matches](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/11B23/production/_88738427_pic1go.jpg) I changed the stones and the color of the board and background.
